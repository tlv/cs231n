Stanford CS231n
===============

This is a collection of documents for Stanford's CS231n class, Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Spring 2017), that I've compiled for my own use. It includes lecture notes and assignments.

Lecture videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
